Commerce is a site that allows big organizations, mainly being adventist schools, to place orders.
The program has many different roles that allow for task delegation throughout the process. This makes it highly configurable for it's users.
You can have diferent categories, price lists and custom order approval flux, depending on which school places an order, if it's from Argentina or another country in South America.

### My part
This is a big on-going project, the publishing house has many different areas that need to interact with the program and therefore it grows bigger as time passes.
Originally the work started with a small team in which everyone could work as full-stack developer, allowing everyone on the team to know what the stack looked like. After the initial months of work I was put in charge of the frontend part of the application, working as developer and as code reviewer.

### About the stack
The frontend of Commerce is developed in VueJS, a Javascript framework that is know for being friendly for newcomers but scaling really well for bigger apps.
We also implemented Nuxt Js, which allows for easier routing and easier integration with packages as the application scales.
The style is done with TailwindCSS, which is problably on of the fastest ways to get highly personalized components at the moment.
It's classed base system with intellisense allows for an awesome developer expirience, and the ability to configure and override classes makes it as powerful as using plain CSS, with the added benefit that is way faster to write.
The backend part of the application in writen in C# and uses Microsoft's .NET Core framework.
