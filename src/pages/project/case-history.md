Straightforward program to manage the clinical history of patients with user friendly interface.
Provides a template for the interview and physical examination.
Ideal for both out patient consults and telemedicine.

### My part
The project was carried out by myself, with frequent consultation with the product owner to meet their specific needs.
I worked all across the stack during the implementation (*frontend, backend, database, and deployment*).

### About the stack
I chose to work with NextJS framework which is based on React, but offers extra functionality like Server Side Rendering of HTML pages.  
For the database I used MongoDB since it's document oriented, and close to the actual working model and management of case histories.  
Then some serverless functions writen in NodeJS syntax do the work to save and retrieve the documents via API calls.
